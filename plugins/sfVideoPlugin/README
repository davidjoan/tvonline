sfVideoPlugin
=============

The `sfVideoPlugin` is a symfony plugin providing easy interface for flash
video player to embed in symfony projects.

Installation
============

Install the plugin via the subversion repository:

    $ svn co http://svn.symfony-project.com/plugins/sfVideoPlugin/trunk plugins/sfVideoPlugin

from the project root directory or by using the command:

    $ ./symfony plugin:install sfVideoPlugin

Right after the installation of the plugin, you should update plugin assets:

    $ ./symfony plugin:publish-assets

so that the default JS and CSS files of the plugin are accessible. Everything
is done properly now.

Usage
=====

Go to the _config_ directory of the plugin and uncomment all lines in the
_routing.yml_ file.

Enable the sfVideo module in your application's config/settings.yml
enabled_modules section:

    [php]
    enabled_modules: [ ..., sfVideo ]

Run the following URL in your browser:

    http://your-site/video

You may choose from 3 example flv files to display. An example of linking flv
file is shown in sfVideo/templates/indexSuccess.php.

Video templates
===============

The plugin is provided with a ready-to-use partial template:

    [php]
    include_partial('sfVideo/video', array('file' => '01.flv'));

Each flv file is fetched from __web/sfVideoPlugin/flv__ directory.

Multi-video
===========

You can display as many players as you want on one page if you set different
_player_ parameter for each of them. Just define an array of players in action
code:

    [php]
    $this->players = array(
      array('file' => '01.flv', 'player' => 'player01'),
      array('file' => '02.flv', 'player' => 'player02'),
      array('file' => '03.flv', 'player' => 'player03'),
    );

JS script managing flowplayer replaces <a> HTML tags with flash players and each
tag has to have a unique id parameter (_player01_, _player02_, _player03_
above). Temlate code should be similar to:

    [php]
    foreach($players as $p)
      include_partial('sfVideo/video', $p);

The plugin is provided with multi-video action example. Run the following URL in
your browser:

    http://your-site/multi-video

Widget
======

You may use a video widget (__sfVideoWidget__ class) inside your form, e.g. in
an upload form.

    [php]
    $form->setOption('url', '/sfVideoPlugin/flv/01.flv');
